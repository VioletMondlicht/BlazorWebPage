# BlazorWebPage

This is my first Blazor project i made in my apprenticeship.<br>
At work i made it with the company framework, that is why i only have a few commits here, because i copied my own code to a standalone project, fixed every version issues it had and commited it then. :) <br>
My Page includes:

1. Landing Page
2. Cat Facts you get from an foreign API from the internet
3. A Calculator with my own logic (with tokenizer/parser/interpreter)
4. My GitHub Account linked
